Showoff is a game created for cardists to test their skill and
knowledge in cardistry!

## Standard ruleset:

1. Each player starts by dealing three cards in front of them - these are your
   "lives".
1. Each player cuts to a random card in the deck.  
   The person with the highest-valued card starts first.  
   Note:
   - Aces are high.
   - If you cut to a Joker, you get to cut again.
   - If you're using a deck without values... then too bad!
1. On each player's turn, hit the 'Next turn' button to generate a random
   category.
   - To complete their turn, the player must successfully perform a move
     from that category.
   - If the player fails, then they remove one of their cards in front of them,
     losing one "life" and ending their turn.
   - A player can fail by:
     - Dropping any amount of cards,
     - Repeating a move that has been done by anyone that game,
     - Not being able to think of a move to perform that fits that category,
1. The game ends when one player loses all their 'lives', leaving the other
   player as the winner (with all their according bragging rights).

## Modifiers:

- With this optional mode activated, extra challenges are added into the game
  at random in order to raise the stakes.
- On each turn, there's a chance that the move category will also be generated
  along with a 'modifier' below.
- If a modifier is added, then the player must fulfill the entire challenges'
  conditions - both the move category **WITH** the modifier - in order to
  successfully complete their turn.  
  If they fail to do so, then that player loses a life.
- With great risk comes great rewards, of course:  
  if a player completes a turn using a modifier, then their opponent loses one
  life, thereby expediting the game.

## Battle Royal:

This mode is intended for three players and above.

1. In this mode, each player deals out two lives instead of three in order to
   expedite the game.
1. Players cut high card to determine who starts first.
   Play then continues in a clockwise direction, or - if playing online - in
   alphabetical order of the player's names.
1. Battle Royale mode can also be played using modifiers.  
   If a player makes a successful play with a modifier, then they can 'target'
   any other opponent and cause them to lose one life.

## Solo Mode

Showoff can still be played entirely by yourself!

1. As with the basic mode, deal out three "lives" in front of you.
1. On each turn, tap the 'Next turn' button to generate a category, and perform
   a move from that category.
1. If you succeed, then tap the button again to generate a category for your
   next turn.
1. If you fail, then lose a "life".
1. The game ends when you run out of lives.

Think of solo mode as a way to practice for Showoff battles and test your own
skills and knowledge independently!
