                  Showoff is a game created for cardists to test their skill and
                  knowledge in cardistry!<br />
                </p>

                <section>
                  <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold dark:text-white">
                    Here's how to play Showoff:
                  </h3>
                  <ol class="ml-5 list-decimal">
                    <li>
                      Start by dealing three cards in front of you. These are
                      your 'lives'
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Have each player cut to a random card in the deck. The
                      person with the highest-valued card starts first (Aces are
                      high. If you cut to a Joker, you get to cut again. Also,
                      if you're using a deck without values... then too bad!)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      On each player's turn, tap/click the 'category'/'next
                      turn' button to generate a random category. The player
                      must now perform a move from that category to successfully
                      complete their turn.
                    </li>
                    <li>If the player:</li>
                    <ol class="ml-10 list-decimal">
                      <li>Drops any cards</li>
                      <li>
                        Repeats a move that has been done by anyone else before
                        in that particular game
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Can't think of any move to perform that fits that
                        category
                      </li>
                    </ol>
                    <li class="list-none">
                      ...then they remove one of their cards in front of them,
                      losing one 'life' and ending their turn.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The game ends when one player loses all their 'lives',
                      leaving the other player as the winner (with all their
                      according bragging rights)
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                </section>

                <section>
                  <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold dark:text-white">Modifiers</h3>
                  <ol class="ml-5 list-decimal">
                    <li>
                      With this optional mode activated, extra challenges are
                      added into the game at random in order to raise the stakes
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      On each turn, there's a chance that the move category will
                      also be generated along with a 'modifier' below.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If a modifier is added, then the player must fulfill the
                      entire challenges's conditions - both the move category
                      WITH the modifier - in order to successfully complete
                      their turn. If they fail to do so, then that player loses
                      a life.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      With great risk comes great rewards, of course: if a
                      player completes a turn using a modifier, then their
                      opponent loses one life, thereby expediting the game.
                    </li>
                  </ol>

                    Battle Royale
                  </h3>
                  <ol class="ml-5 list-decimal">
                    <li>This mode is for 3+ players and above.</li>
                    <li>
                      In this mode, each player deals out 2 lives instead of 3
                      in order to expedite the game.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Players cut high card to determine who starts first. The
                      play then continues in a clockwise direction. (If playing
                      online, play continues in alphabetical order of the
                      playerâ€™s names).
                    </li>
                    <li>As per regular play, if any of the players:</li>
                    <ol class="ml-10 list-decimal">
                      <li>Drops any cards</li>
                      <li>
                        Repeats a move that has been done by anyone else before
                        in that particular game
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Can't think of any move to perform that fits that
                        category
                      </li>
                    </ol>
                    <li class="list-none">
                      ...then that player loses 1 life. If a player loses all of
                      their lives, then they are knocked out of the game.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The game ends when only one player is left standing.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Battle Royale mode can also be played using modifiers. If
                      a player makes a successful play with a modifier, then
                      they can 'target' any other opponent and cause them to
                      lose 1 life.
                    </li>
