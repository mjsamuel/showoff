Showoff is a game created for cardists to test their skill and knowledge in
cardistry!

# Here's how to play Showoff:

1. Start by dealing three cards in front of you. These are your 'lives'
1. Have each player cut to a random card in the deck. The person with the
   highest-valued card starts first (Aces are high. If you cut to a Joker, you
   get to cut again. Also, if you're using a deck without values... then too
   bad!)
1. On each player's turn, tap/click the 'category'/'next turn' button to
   generate a random category. The player must now perform a move from that
   category to successfully complete their turn.
1. If the player:
   1. Drops any cards
   1. Repeats a move that has been done by anyone else before in that particular
      game
   1. Can't think of any move to perform that fits that category
   1. ...then they remove one of their cards in front of them, losing one 'life'
      and ending their turn.
1. The game ends when one player loses all their 'lives', leaving the other
   player as the winner (with all their according bragging rights)

# Modifiers

1. With this optional mode activated, extra challenges are added into the game
   at random in order to raise the stakes
1. On each turn, there's a chance that the move category will also be generated
   along with a 'modifier' below.
1. If a modifier is added, then the player must fulfill the entire challenges's
   conditions - both the move category WITH the modifier - in order to
   successfully complete their turn. If they fail to do so, then that player
   loses a life.
1. With great risk comes great rewards, of course: if a player completes a turn
   using a modifier, then their opponent loses one life, thereby expediting the
   game.

# Battle Royale

1. This mode is for 3+ players and above.
1. In this mode, each player deals out 2 lives instead of 3 in order to expedite
   the game.
1. Players cut high card to determine who starts first. The play then continues
   in a clockwise direction. (If playing online, play continues in alphabetical
   order of the playerâ€™s names).
1. As per regular play, if any of the players:
   1. Drops any cards
   1. Repeats a move that has been done by anyone else before in that particular
      game
   1. Can't think of any move to perform that fits that category
   1. ...then that player loses 1 life. If a player loses all of their lives,
      then they are knocked out of the game.
1. The game ends when only one player is left standing.
1. Battle Royale mode can also be played using modifiers. If a player makes a
   successful play with a modifier, then they can 'target' any other opponent
   and cause them to lose 1 life.
